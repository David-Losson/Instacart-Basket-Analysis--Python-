**Data**

Open source data from Instacart's 2017 made available [here](https://www.instacart.com/datasets/grocery-shopping-2017).

**Tools**

The exploratory analysis was conducted in Python using the following tools and libraries:

  -Anaconda 3
  -Jupyter Notebook
  -Pandas
  -Seaborn
  -Matplotlib
  -Scipy
  -Numpy

**Result**

Late morning and afternoon hours represent the vast majority of purchases- spiking upwards from 7-10AM and falling gradually from 3PM-12AM. Ordering peaks during the weekends (Friday-Sunday) and bottoms out by mid-week (Wednesday). Most of the products ordered through the platform are under $25 and the vast majority of those are under $15. Certain departments account for more high- and mid-priced items, while others are dominated by very low-cost products. Instacart has many loyal, frequent shoppers and their customer base is dominated by married people, both with and without children, who tend to be quite loyal and frequent shoppers. General ordering habits are quite stable by region and age group.
